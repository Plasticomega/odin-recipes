    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Marinate the Chicken:</li></h3>
            In a bowl, mix chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Allow it to marinate for at least 1-2 hours.
        <h3><li>Cook the Rice:</li></h3>
        Boil soaked basmati rice in a pot with water, bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and salt until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the water.
        <h3><li>Prepare Fried Onions:</li></h3>
        In a separate pan, fry thinly sliced onions until golden brown. Set aside for later use.
        <h3><li>Cook the Chicken:</li></h3>
        In a large pan, heat ghee or oil. Add cumin seeds, then add marinated chicken. Cook until the chicken is browned and cooked through. Add tomatoes and cook until they soften.
        <h3><li>Layering:</li></h3>
        In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer half of the partially cooked rice, followed by the cooked chicken mixture. Sprinkle half of the garam masala, coriander powder, red chili powder, and fried onions. Repeat the layers.

        <h3><li>Final Cooking:</li></h3>
        Drizzle saffron-soaked milk over the top layer. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and aromatic.
        <h3><li>Garnish and Serve:</li></h3>
        Garnish with chopped coriander leaves, mint leaves, and fried onions. Serve hot with raita or a side salad.

    </ol>
